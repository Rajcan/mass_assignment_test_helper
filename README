mass_assignment_test_helper
===========================

his is a test helper that you can place into your test_helper.rb file to aid in testing your ActiveRecord models against mass assignment vulnerabilities.
 
The following form adds a method named test_mass_assignment_is_secure
to your class, so that mass assignment checks are a bit prettier:
 
test_mass_assignment_secure SomeModel, :first_name, :last_name
 
You can also just assert mass security in your test with:
 
assert_mass_assignment_secure SomeModel, :first_name, :last_name
 
In both instances the first argument is the name of the model that you want to test, and :first_name and :last_name fields are fields that are meant to be open to mass assignment.
